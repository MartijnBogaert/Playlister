Since not everyone has an Apple Music subscription, but connecting to Apple Music is an important condition to be able to use the app, all Playlister's functionalities are demonstrated in [this video](https://youtu.be/Yza6zUwYZeE).

## TestFlight

Playlister is currently under review for TestFlight's beta testing program. When the app gets approved, a public TestFlight link will be provided here. Until then, the only way to use the app is by downloading its source code and signing it through Xcode.
